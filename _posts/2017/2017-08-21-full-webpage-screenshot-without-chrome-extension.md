To get started,
1. Open Developer tools `` ⌘ + ⌥ + i `` (Mac) or `` Ctrl + Shift + I `` (windows) or Chrome Settings -> More Tools -> Developer Tools.
2. Open Command Menu
  *  [Latest version of Google Chrome (Chrome 59)](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/devtools-release-notes){:target="_blank"} introduces Command Menu (command palette like in sublime and atom), which can be opened by ``  ⌘ + ⇧ + P `` (Mac) or `` Ctrl + Shift + P `` (Windows, Linux) inside DevTools.
3. Start typing screenshot and select **Capture full size screenshot**. and aahaa!! that's it.
